# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

First clone this repo. Prerequisites include Ruby version 2.5.0 and Ruby on Rails 5.2.3, as stated in the Gemfile at the time of writing this. 

From the project root, run these commands in your terminal.

```
$ gem install bundler:2.0.2
```
then...
```
$ bundle install
```
then...
```
rails db:create
```
then...
```
rails db:migrate
```

The project should now be set up. You may run into issues depending on your Ruby version, update accordingly.

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
